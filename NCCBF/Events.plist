			<string>Minyo has been handed down from generation to generation. These dances evolved from ancient traditions when people danced and sang to pray for good harvest and honor their ancestors. Nearly every district of Japan has a rich heritage of songs that reveal the characteristics of the local people
and their history. There are rice planting and fishing songs, as well as songs of carpenters, miners, sailors and craftsmen. Some lyrics praise scenic beauty, and others tell stories of historical figures and festivals. The performances at the Minyo Minbu Festival during the Cherry Blossom Festival will include singing and dancing to Japanese folk songs and shamisen gasso (shamisen mass playing).</string>
